# PathFinding_Visualiser
Ever felt like needing a utility that gives a visualisation of how a path finding algorithm works? This does exactly that, powered by some amazing ReactJS Animation and transitions to give a sublime feel of the algorithms flow! 
For those, who want to see it in action, here is a quick link: [https://peaceful-mesa-07537.herokuapp.com/](https://pathfindingvisualiser.onrender.com)

----------
### Algoriithms built in;
* Dijkstra's
* Depth First Search - Randomised
* Depth First Search - Normal
* A* Seacrh
* Breadth First Search - Bidirectional
* Breadth First Search - Normal

### Maze Finding Algorihms:
* Recursive Division
* Recursive Backtracking
* Random Maze

### Features:
* Real time solution update, upon click and drag of end node
* One can add a middle node, to force solution to reach end node only ater visiting the mid node


### DrawBacks:
* There is a known bug, when the user performs a 'click and drag'

# PathFinding_Visualiser
Ever felt like needing a utility that gives a visualisation of how a path finding algorithm works? This does exactly that, powered by some amazing ReactJS Animation and transitions to give a sublime feel of the algorithms flow! 
For those, who want to see it in action, here is a quick link: https://peaceful-mesa-07537.herokuapp.com/

----------
### Algoriithms built in;
* Dijkstra's
* Depth First Search - Randomised
* Depth First Search - Normal
* A* Seacrh
* Breadth First Search - Bidirectional
* Breadth First Search - Normal

### Maze Finding Algorihms:
* Recursive Division
* Recursive Backtracking



### DrawBacks:
* There is a known bug, when the user performs a 'click and drag'
